# Data dictionary

All paths are relative to `data/`. The frozen outputs (`frozen/calibration`, `frozen/transitions`, `frozen/applicability`) are the files behind the paper's reported numbers and are never modified by the code in this repository. SHA-256 hashes are in `MANIFEST_SHA256.json` at the repository root.

## Units used throughout

| Quantity | Unit | Typical column suffix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flow, capacity, service rate | veh/h/lane | `_vph`, `_vphpl` |
| Density | veh/mi/lane | `kj`, `kq`, `kc` |
| Speed | mph | `_mph` |
| Length | mi | `_mi` |
| Time, duration, delay | h, unless the column ends in `_min` (minutes) or `_s` (seconds) | `_h` |
| Loading x = D/C | h | `x_h` |
| Emission rate | g/(veh·h) at zero acceleration | `c0..c3` |
| Emissions per vehicle or per episode | g/veh or g/lane | `O_`, `M_`, `S_` columns: g per lane over the episode |
| Acceleration | m/s² | `a_down`, `a_up` |

| Platoon car-following experiment | Measured transitions (Section 6.6) | Provided by Prof. Rui Jiang's group, Beijing Jiaotong University. Raw trajectories are not redistributed. Derived transition records are in `frozen/transitions` |
| MOVES-derived passenger-car rates | All emission calculations | Archived lookup tables in `frozen/calibration/emission_input` and their cubic fit. The original MOVES version, analysis year and settings were not recorded, so emission results can only be reproduced starting from these derived tables |
